                <p>
                  My teaching interests and experience center around
                  undergraduate classes, largely first and second- year topics.
                  I have personal teaching experience in HCI, Databases, Data
                  Structures, Artificial Intelligence, Web Programming, and
                  Introductory Computer Science. I am also very interested in
                  UI/UX and educational technology-related classes.
