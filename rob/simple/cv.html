          <p class="bold">Teaching Interests</p>
          <p>
            My teaching interests and experience center around undergraduate
            classes, largely first and second- year topics. I have personal
            teaching experience in HCI, Databases, Data Structures, Artificial
            Intelligence, Web Programming, and Introductory Computer Science. I
            am also very interested in UI/UX and educational technology-related
            classes.
